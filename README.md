# MazeAnalyzer
MazeAnalyzer is the analysis tool of MazeSuite. MazeAnalyzer can open log files created by MazeWalker and enables researchers to analyze the behavior (e.g., subjectsâ€™ path, time to completion of the maze, number of errors) of the subject in the maze. MazeAnalyzer is also able to load multiple overlapping paths on the same maze, allowing researchers to instantly compare the actions of different subjects. Log files contain information about the path that a subject traveled as well as where the subject looked at each time and other events that occurred with a session.
